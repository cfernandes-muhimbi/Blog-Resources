## 🎮 About the Game

This game is inspired by a wholesome moment when my 4-year-old tried to pop bubbles on a lock screen screensaver. That playful curiosity led to the creation of this calming little game.

### 💡 How it works:
- Configure how long you'd like to play (the **timer**).
- Start popping bubbles as they appear.
- At the end of the timer, you'll see how many bubbles you managed to pop.
- Simple. Fun. Stress-relieving.
