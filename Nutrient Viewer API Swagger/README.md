# **Nutrient Viewer API - Connector for Power Autoamte**

### Cloud-Powered Document Rendering for the Nutrient Web SDK

The **Nutrient Viewer API** — referred to in documentation as the **Document Web Services (DWS) Viewer API** — is a **high-performance, cloud-hosted backend service** that works together with the **Nutrient Web SDK**.
It enables fast, secure, and scalable document rendering for modern web applications, Power Automate flows, and enterprise integrations.

##  **What Is the DWS Viewer API?**

The **DWS Viewer API** is a cloud service that streams document content directly to the **Nutrient Web SDK**.
Instead of the browser loading documents locally, DWS handles rendering, security, and complex document operations in the cloud.

##  **Why Use the DWS Viewer API?**

The DWS Viewer API enhances the Nutrient Web SDK by providing:

---

##  **How It Fits with the Nutrient Web SDK**

You still use the Web SDK in your frontend via:

```ts
NutrientViewer.load(container, config);
```

But instead of loading files from local URLs, SharePoint, or OneDrive, your viewer session is powered entirely by **DWS in the cloud**.

### Typical DWS Workflow

1. **Create a DWS Viewer API App**
   Use the DWS dashboard to generate your first project.

2. **Upload a Test Document**
   The dashboard lets you upload files to generate initial viewer sessions.

3. **Generate a Session Token**
   Use the dashboard token (valid for 24 hours) or generate tokens programmatically in production.

4. **Load the Document Using the Web SDK**
   Pass your DWS token into the Web SDK `load` configuration (see official API docs for exact params).

##  **Integrating with Power Automate (Low-Code / No-Code)**

The **Nutrient Viewer API** integrates seamlessly with low-code workflows.
Common use cases include:

* Opening converted Office files directly in a cloud viewer
* Previewing PDFs generated in a Power Automate flow
* Embedding cloud rendering into approval workflows
* Viewing OCR’d documents created by Power Automate + Nutrient Connectors
* Secure external document sharing using viewer tokens instead of sending files

Use Nutrient connectors to generate PDFs, perform OCR, or manipulate documents — then display the output using the DWS Viewer API.
